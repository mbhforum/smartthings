 er: Kevin Kampman\n\nToo often\, security is an outsider to business g
 rowth and adoption of new capabilities\, and that probably holds true 
 for your organization. Does the mention of security for projects and n
 ew applications cause you to lose interest or gaze at the ceiling? Is 
 security something that has hindered progress or introduced barriers a
 t critical points in project adoption? Is there a history of disconnec
 ted activities that culminate in yet another conflict? If you answered
  “yes” to any of these\, then you need to rethink the influence of sec
 urity in your development community. This invitation-only\, compliment
 ary\, video\, virtual briefing looks at the organizational changes you
  need to bring security and development together in a productive and c
 omplementary manner\, to minimize risk and improve the quality of appl
 ications.\n• Remove barriers to cooperation \n• Target development and
  security on shared objectives\n• Best practices to achieve high-quali
 ty outcomes\nContact us at gartnerwebinars@gartner.com with questions 
 about viewing this virtual briefing.
